# README
This notebook demonstrates the process of cleaning data, preparing it for machine learning, training a RandomForestRegressor model, removing outliers, and evaluating the model's performance. It covers the following steps:

Data Loading and Cleaning: Load the dataset and drop rows with missing values.
Data Preparation: Define features and target variable, and preprocess the data.
Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Train the RandomForestRegressor model.
Removing Outliers: Remove outliers from the test data using the IQR method.
Cleaned Test Data Predictions: Make predictions and visualize actual vs. predicted values.
The code ensures that the data is clean, the model is trained properly, and the predictions are evaluated accurately
